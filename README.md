# Vuejs-Crash-Course

Welcome to my Vue.js crash course! Lets build a simple User Generator, where user can generate random users. A very basic and simple application to get started with VueJs.

 This README will guide you through the setup and usage of this project.

## Getting Started

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine and just run the live server and boom:
